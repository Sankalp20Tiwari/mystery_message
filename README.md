The project emphasizes performance, scalability, and user experience.

## 🚀 Features
- **User-friendly interface** for seamless feedback submission
- **Real-time feedback management** for administrators
- **Authentication system** (if applicable)
- **Mobile-responsive design** ensuring accessibility across devices
- **Optimized performance** with server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG)
- **Modern UI** powered by Tailwind CSS
- **Secure API interactions** for data integrity

   cd feedback_app
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```
4. **Configure environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define the necessary environment variables:
